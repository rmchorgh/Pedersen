# Pedersen

This is Pedersen. It's named after the guy the guy that patented tandem bikes first.

Tandem is a company I don't like, because they took my money without telling my their Mobi pump doesn't work on beta versions of iOS.

Use this open source version of their app if you want to change stuff about your pump, but its not my fault if you hurt yourself. Be warned.

Thanks to [James Woglom](https://github.com/jwoglom). A lot of this is based on his previous work.
